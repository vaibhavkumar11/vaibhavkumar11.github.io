      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a B.Tech student at the Department of Applied Mathematics, Delhi Technological University, India. My current work is focused on classification of protein structures. I have been interested in computer vision problems and have been trying to learn more about them. These days I have also been taking part in kaggle competitions as a means to widen my knowledge of machine learning and picking up nifty tricks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my free time I watch football and I&amp;rsquo;m a huge Barcelona supporter. In the premier league, I support Liverpool and usually my weekends are reserved for watching matches(unless there is an international break). Also I like landscape photography and listen to alot of indie music.&lt;/p&gt;
